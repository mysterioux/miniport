A super simple responsive portfolio template. It's only a single page because hey, sometimes
you don't need a half dozen pages to make your point.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

Mini-Portfolio is just a simple abstract web presence created under some few hours using component based re-engineering to mimick a site I found online. Use as you pleased, customize and tweet. For learning and personal purposes only
